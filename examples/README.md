This script demonstrates how to use the functionality provided by the `clocklock` module, with a specific focus on the `run_with_timeout` function from `clocklock.timeoutter`.

### Instructions

1. First, make sure to install the project with Poetry. Navigate to the project's root directory and run:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. Run `example_usage.py` with Poetry from the root directory:
  ```bash
  poetry run python examples/example_usage.py
  ```
An output will be displayed in the console according to the operations performed in the script.

Remember to always use `poetry run` to ensure you're using the correct Python environment where `clocklock` package is installed.

These examples should help you get started with the ClockLock system. For further information, visit the main project page.
